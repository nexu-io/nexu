# Desktop Runtime Guide

This guide covers desktop-specific working rules, structure, and troubleshooting for `apps/desktop`.

## Observability boundary

- Optimize first for agent/debugging efficiency, not human-facing control panel UX.
- Prefer changes inside `apps/desktop/main/`, `apps/desktop/src/`, and `apps/desktop/shared/` when improving local runtime observability.
- Desktop-internal observability changes may be relatively aggressive when they improve structured diagnostics, event correlation, runtime state introspection, or local log transport reliability.
- Keep the boundary strict for `apps/web`, `apps/api`, and `apps/gateway`: default to no changes.
- If touching `apps/web`, `apps/api`, or `apps/gateway` is unavoidable for desktop observability work, limit the change to logging only: log fields, log level, stable reason codes, or propagation of desktop correlation ids.
- Do not use desktop observability work as a reason to refactor behavior, state models, or interfaces in `apps/web`, `apps/api`, or `apps/gateway`.
- Prefer machine-queryable diagnostics over presentation-oriented additions: structured events, reason codes, action ids, session/boot correlation ids, and incremental event streams.

## Directory structure

- `apps/desktop/main/` — Electron main-process code: app bootstrap, IPC registration, runtime orchestration, updater integration, and file/log side effects.
- `apps/desktop/main/runtime/` — Local runtime supervision only: manifests, unit lifecycle, structured runtime logging, probes, and process state transitions.
- `apps/desktop/preload/` — Narrow bridge surface between Electron main and renderer. Keep it thin and explicit.
- `apps/desktop/src/` — Renderer UI only. Prefer consuming typed host APIs instead of embedding Electron/runtime knowledge directly in components.
- `apps/desktop/src/lib/` — Renderer-side adapters for host bridge calls and desktop-specific client helpers.
- `apps/desktop/shared/` — Contracts shared by main/preload/renderer, including host API types and runtime config structures. Prefer putting cross-boundary types here first.
- `apps/desktop/scripts/` — Build, packaging, and sidecar preparation scripts. Keep runtime behavior out of these scripts unless it is strictly packaging-related.
- Keep process-management logic out of renderer files; keep presentation logic out of `main/`; keep cross-boundary DTOs out of feature-local files when they are shared by IPC.

## Common troubleshooting

- `desktop won't cold start`
  - Start with `pnpm desktop:logs` and `./apps/desktop/dev.sh devlog`.
  - Then inspect `cold-start.log`, `desktop-main.log`, and `logs/runtime-units/*.log` under the desktop logs directory.
  - Correlate by `desktop_boot_id` first, then `desktop_session_id` if auth/session recovery is involved.

- `a runtime unit looks running but behavior is broken`
  - Check the unit's structured lifecycle/probe logs in `apps/desktop/main/runtime/` outputs before changing UI.
  - Verify whether the issue is process presence, port readiness, auth bootstrap, or delegated-process detection.
  - Prefer fixing state/probe semantics in the orchestrator instead of adding renderer-side heuristics.

- `control panel state looks stale or noisy`
  - Inspect `apps/desktop/main/runtime/daemon-supervisor.ts` first, especially polling, probe, and state-transition logging paths.
  - Reduce duplicate event emission in main process before adding renderer filtering.

- `desktop observability work starts touching api/web/gateway`
  - Re-check the observability boundary above.
  - Default answer is to move the change back into desktop unless the only missing piece is a log field, level, reason code, or correlation id.

- `unclear where a new type or helper belongs`
  - If it crosses main/preload/renderer boundaries, put it in `apps/desktop/shared/`.
  - If it only affects runtime supervision, keep it in `apps/desktop/main/runtime/`.
  - If it only changes UI rendering, keep it in `apps/desktop/src/`.
